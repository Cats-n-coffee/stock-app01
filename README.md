Two different APIs used: stocks values and Google Charts.

Alpha Advantage API used: 
    - intraday
    - daily
    - weekly
    - monthly
    - search

Intraday display is set as the default data display after a search, or clicking a previous search.
Local Storage used to store and retreive searches.

To use the candleSticks chart, since multiple numbers are needed to display data, an array is passed as parameter to the function drawChart().
